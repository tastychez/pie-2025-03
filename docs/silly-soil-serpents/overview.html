				<h2 class="align-center">Process</h2>
				<p> To get from our idea to our product, we followed a process of design, testing, and iteration. We
                    used scrum project management to delegate tasks and stay on track. As designs started working better, 
                    we promoted them to high fidelity fabrication and implementation.

						<h3>Starting Off: Project Management and Ideation</h3>
						<p>
							The first part of the process involved setting up a Miro board to track and delegate
                            tasks. At this point in the project, most tasks were researching electrical components 
                            that we should purchase and making our first mechanical designs in Onshape.

						<h3>Sprint 1</h3>
						<p>
							Once we had made decisions about what electrical components to purchase and use,
                            specifically the servo motors and the sensor, we designed and 3D printed our first
                            iteration. The first iteration helped us identify what needed to be added to the 
                            mechanical design, such as holes for wiring, and what we could do to improve electrical
                            performance, which in this case was using stronger motors. We also managed to get a working
                            prototype of the snake moving in an inchworm motion using an Arduino.

						<h3>Sprint 2</h3>
						<p>
							After testing out what worked and did not work with our first iteration, we started
                            designing the next. We wanted to try using smaller servo motors and making the robot
                            lighter overall, however we found that the smaller motors did not have high enough 
                            torque to accomplish the movements we desired. We started designing more mechanisms,
                            such as the "head" and "tail" of the snake, and the sensor-lowering mechanism. We also 
                            starting testing and calibrating our soil moisture sensor in different levels of wet soil.
                            A major goal for this sprint was getting the snake to move in a serpentine movement,
                            which we managed to do using an arduino. This sprint also involved getting the 
                            live dashboard set up and starting to iterate on the skin design.

                <h3>Sprint 3</h3>
				<p>We came across several challenges in this project, and most of them came
                    at this integration stage. Specifically, integrating electrical hardware with
                    software was difficult for the moisture sensor, camera, and Pico boards. This is 
                    when we decided to add the raspberry pi as a ground station instead of our computers.
                    We were able to meet two of our goals for software, having a wireless snake and a 
                    dashboard that could control the snake remotely. But they did not work together...

                <p>Energy and data flow through several paths in our integrated system. 
                One challenge that we faced with integration is the weight of the power source, 
                which in our case was a NiMh battery. We found that it weighed the tail down, 
                and therefore shaped decisions about motor power and mechanical design around this.
