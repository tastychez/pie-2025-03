					<p>Serpentine Motion</p>
					<p>A classic snake motion, serpentine motion relies on friction between the 
					snake and the ground to push it forward. We recreated this movement with a mathematical 
					model with parameters that are tuned based on the snakes length, number of segments, speed, 
					and direction of motion. The image below shows a simulation in MATLAB of direction of the 
					after adjusting the direction parameter.</p>

					<p>Concertina Motion</p>
					<p>Concertina motion resembles inchworm motion, and is used by snakes when they have
						objects to push off of tp propel them forward. Our snake pushed off of the floor,
						and was propelled by the friction between the head and the rug.

					<p>Sidewinding Motion</p>
					<p>Sidewinding motion moves the snake perpendicular to the direction that it 
						would be moving in if it were using serpentine motion. It lifts some parts of 
						its body while pushing off of the ground with the others, creating a distinct trail 
						behind it. Snakes use this form of motion in the desert when they need to move up slopes
						covered with sand. The image below shows an early sketch of sidewinding motion being 
						translated to our snake's mobility.

						<h3>Application to the Robot</h3>
						<p>
							After reading researchers' work on how snake locomotion can be applied to 
							robotics, we calculated how the motors should move to replicate snake motion 
							in our robot. This video shows successful execution of serpentine motion.

					<h2>Software Setup</h2>
					<p>
					We communicated with our Raspberry Pi and Picos through a linux based terminal on
					a Windows machine. Our initial plan was to use USB connection between the Windows 
					machine and Picos but it proved to be unreliable. We experienced a multitude of 
					connection issues, such as changing ports, inconsistent usb detection, and errors
					when uploading firmware. Given that these issues sprouted from passing the connection
					to the Linux terminal through the Windows terminal, we shifted to using a Linux machine
					in hopes of reducing the possibility of instability.
					</p>
					<p>
					This shift, in theory, would have allowed us to communicate directly with the Picos.
					Unfortunately, we continued to have connnection issues. With the deadline approaching,
					the Raspberry Pi seemed to be our only hope. Luckily, we were able to establish a reliable connection
					via SSH within a few minutes! We did not have connection issues for the remainder of the project
					</p>
				
					<h2>MicroPython and Firmware</h2>
					<p>
					Our Pico Ws were connected to the Pi via usb for the first week of testing. We then shifted to
					wifi based connection to avoid chord and wire pulling. The Picos were flashed with micropython 
					firmware to allow python files to be communicated through the linux terminal. 
					<p>
					We changed the firmware on our Picos depending on their needs. Our soil sensor Pico required us 
					to flash Circuit Python while our camera Pico required us to flash C, as we communicated through
					Arduino IDE. 
					</p>

					<h2>Pico and Pi Communication</h2>
					<p>
					Connected to the Pi via SSH, we were able to push python scripts to the Picos from our terminal. All 
					mathematical computations for the snake's movement were performed by the Pi. These computations were
					then converted to serial data and communicated to the Picos via usb or wifi.
