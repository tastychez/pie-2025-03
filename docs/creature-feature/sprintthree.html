					<b> Sprint 3 Mechanical Design</b><br>

					Here is the sprint 3 prototype in action. This showcases the new string and foam design with the 3D
					printed spine. It does not show the base
					shape change yet.

					right-margin="auto" alt="fullAssem" class="center">
				<p>After we solidified how we wanted to pivot our design, we got to work refining all of the details and
					creating more CAD for individual pieces. We changed the base's design to be more interesting in the
					form of an octagon,
					but that posed its own unique challenge with the fact that the box joints don't line up perfectly.
					Because we were thinking of
					how to assemble everything, we created mounts for all of the components and put emphasis on
					finalizing their placement in the base.
					The faceplate was also created to house the LED screen eyes and add to the space aesthetic of the
					creature.

					Here is the CAD for some of the individual components. The speakers, LED screen, RGB light, button,
					spool, and beak movers
					are featured in this image.
				</p>
				<p> An important aspect that we adjusted in this sprint is that we changed the springs to foam. We found
					the springs to be too
					stiff and they did not allow for the slats to bend enough. After a lot of deliberation, we decided
					that upholstery foam would
					be perfect. We updated the slat CAD to include many little holes to allow the foam to be sewn on. We
					also got to work creating
					large spools that allow the strings that pulls the creature to spool around once. There are three
					spools with one on top of
					each servo.

					<b> Sprint 3 Electrical Design</b><br>
					<img src="images/final circuit white bg.png" width="900" height="auto" display="block"
						left-margin="auto" right-margin="auto" alt="fullAssem" class="center">
				<p>It was during this sprint that the final circuit design was finalized, including Pin numbers that
					could
					be shared with software. A final power supply was ordered. The full circuit was wired and soldered
					together the
					same day the power supply arrived. It includes the Pi with a speaker bonnet and two speakers, two
					OLED screens,
					three servos, the two sensors, the pixel LEDs, and three buttons.
				</p>

					left-margin="auto" right-margin="auto" alt="fullAssem" class="center">
				<p>When the circuit was first wired, our focus was on quick completion so testing of components and
					inital code testing
					could be completed. Additionally, there were no heat guns available for use during the soldering
					process that day,
					so electrical tape was used as a temporary substitute. Once the testing process was underway, and on
					a day that the other software
					subteam member was busy, wire management became the focus. We added heatshrink tubing and
					resoldering to more appropriate lengths
					based on the known mechanical requirements. We also made sure to properly detangle everything and
					twist or tape things together to
					minimize future issues.

				<p>Another major step for electrical this sprint was getting the screens up and running. We had to do
					research on SPI control, specifically
					with the screens we had that required 10 pins to be wired. It took significant effort and testing to
					ensure that everything was properly secured
					because we had a set of pins that were fairly easy to bend and we didn't have the appropriate
					connector. The appropriate connector wouldn't have
					been of much use to use because we were soldering the screens to the speaker bonnet breakout holes.
					We tested continuity before applying power
					which was good because we had to remove a small amount of solder connecting two pins. It took a full
					day and the joint effort of software and electrical (or rather one
					person on both subteams) to get the screens fully operational due to a lack of existing drivers that
					would have worked for our project.

				<b> Sprint 3 Software Design</b><br>
				<img src="images\sprint 3 software.png"
					width="900" height="auto" display="block" left-margin="auto" right-margin="auto" alt="fullAssem"
					class="center">
				<p>With the speakers and screens wired, we were ready to integrate them into the software. The first step was 
					writing custom drivers for both the speakers and the screens, allowing us to run audio files and animations 
					quickly and easily using simple function calls. This approach helped keep our final state machine(s) much 
					cleaner.</p>
				<p>
					Since this sprint marked our first time integrating the state machine with all of the electrical components, 
					we opted to use the simplified state machine pictured above. In this version, we only implemented part of one 
					possible loop of the system. This loop used all of our components except for the buttons, which were implemented later, 
					and the servos, which would have added a significant level of complexity to testing and were therefore excluded from 
					this initial integration.
				</p>
				<p>
					Integrating this smaller portion of the state machine allowed us to debug individual aspects of the system much more 
					quickly than if we had worked with the full implementation. It also provided the foundation needed to revise the 
					complete state machine and made the next round of integration considerably smoother.
