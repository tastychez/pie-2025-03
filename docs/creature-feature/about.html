								<h2>Our Goal</h2>
								<p>We wanted a project that has a solid balance of mechanical, electrical, and software engineering. Our goal was to get practice with integrating systems effectively. We decided that making a toy does a great job at integrating all of these aspects. The Creature is heavily integrated because it relies on constant inputs and responses. In order to move it needs to have the software to idle, then it needs to respond to a button press and react accordingly. We decided that making a toy does a great job at integrating all of these aspects.</p>
								
								<h2>Meet the Team</h2>
								<p>There are four members of the team. We divided our work into multiple subteams to focus on mechanical, electrical, and software design.</p>

								<b>Primary Work:</b> mechanical design & fabrication & assembly<br>
								<b>Specifics: </b> designed the base mechanical design and created all the prototypes.
								Helped assemble the final product and created many components in OnShape.

								<br>
								<b>Primary Work:</b> mechanical design & website <br>
								<b>Specifics:</b> aided Anna and Brenna in mechanical design by creating components in OnShape, 3D-printing
								parts, and helping assemble various things. Designed the base website and made the Full System diagram and the images
								for the Energy and Data Flow diagram.

								</span>
								<br>
								<b>Primary Work:</b> software design & mechanical design & implementation <br>
								<b>Specifics:</b> Started off as the software lead but transitioned to mechanical lead later on in the project. 
								Created a finite state machine by running multiple Python scripts and communicating between the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi.

								<b>Primary Work:</b> electrical design & software design & implementation <br>
								<b>Specifics:</b> Started off as the electrical lead but transitioned to software lead later on in the project. 
								Created the entire electrical system and coded the screens, speakers, and other parts of the finite state machine.
