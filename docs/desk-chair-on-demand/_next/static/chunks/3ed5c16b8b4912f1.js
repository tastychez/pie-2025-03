This shifting is inevitable — we really don’t know which transform is more “correct” and so we accept there’s some error in the other robots that will result in them shifting. (If we cared about some fixed world coordinate in space, we’d do some sort of pose graph optimization to minimize the error in our robot poses for every pose correction and produce some meaningful pose adjustment given this; in this case, we don’t care about the physical location of the origin, we just want the shifting of it to be deterministic/consistent.) However, if we enforce some order of “trust” of our different robots, we can at least ensure this shifting is deterministic. The easiest way to do this is number our robots and always update the transformation relating the higher-numbered robot to the world.
