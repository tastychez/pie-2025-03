# Project Management

## Budget 

In constructing this project, we were allotted a budget of $250 to spend on obtaining materials.
In addition to this provided budget, we made significant use of a number of physical components that we obtained for free, either due to these components coming from our own personal items we had on hand, or due to options to receive or borrow items from others.

Notes:
    "Found in Robolab" items were unused items salvaged from previous robotics projects, our use of which was cleared with the relevant professor. 
    "Personal" items were those that some of us already owned. 
    All "Found in Robolab" and "Personal" items are listed with their *estimated* costs, as we did not have to pay these costs, but the cost is theoretically integrated into our project.

### Budget Reflection

Our team was able to make ample use of materials we already had and could salvage, with many of the more expensive components we used (computers and cameras) either from personal supplies or found. While this appears to make the total cost of our project significant (on the order of 1,000 dollars,) much of this cost was unnecessary were we choosing components from the ground up.
For instance, the Raspberry Pi 5 that we used actually impeded some of our progress, as the different hardware didn't support hardware level interrupts via PiGPIO and required us to use a container for running our desired version of ROS2, and the Realsense cameras were overkill for this project --- we didn't use their depth data nor their API/library, we simply grabbed the raw video frames when we wanted.
