						    <!-- Keyboard -->
						    <div class="spotlight">
						        <div class="content">
						            <h3><strong>Keyboard</strong></h3>
						            <p>The keyboard design borrows from the original Enigma Machine. It uses spring-loaded metal rods topped with labeled key-caps. When a letter is pressed, the key completes a circuit on the breadboard which gets sent to the arduino for processing.</p>
						            
						            <p>Each key has a 3D printed tab on it. On the rod is a spring that is sandwiched between the tab and the middle plate. When the key is pressed, the spring compresses. The pin at the end of the tab comes into contact with a piece of copper wire, completing the circuit. When the key is let go, the spring decompresses and puts the key back to the original position, breaking the circuit.</p>
						            
						            <p>We chose to make the keypresses send information to the Arduino for one particular reason. When the arduino recieves a signal of the swapped letter, both the pin corresponding to the keypress, and the pin corresponding to the swapped letter will read high. By sending the keyboard press to the arduino first, it can differentiate between the two, allowing it to send the swapped letter (and not the keypress!) to the display.</p>
						            
						            <p>The original idea was to use a small length of solder wick because it was conductive and flexible. However, since solder wick oxidizes so quickly, it might become unreliable, which led us to look for more reliable solutions. To make the connection, we soldered wires onto small pins we found in the Shop that fit perfectly onto the tabs. A small piece of the same copper wire we used for the rotors is glued onto a little stand and soldered to a wire that connects to the breadboard. In the resting position, the pins do not touch the copper, and when a slight bit of pressure is applied, they touch and the circuit is complete.</p>
						            
						            <p>The first iteration we had originally had the copper pieces sticking out from the brackets at an angle. It became clear that this wouldn't work as the springs were too stiff and required too much force to contact well. Instead of redesigning, which would have taken too much time and iteration at that stage of the process, we just glued the copper pieces on top of the brackets, as they were at a good height.</p>
						            
						            <p>A compromise we had to make was not using a lid. We had designed and laser-cut a lid, but with the amount of wires we had, and the non-constant key height, the lid would not fit. If we did this project again, we would have designed to be able to have a lid, which would restrain the keys from wobbling as much as they did.</p>
						            
						            <p>A tradeoff to making the keyboard as opposed to using a standard keyboard is time and redundancy. Since keys are made using springs and many small parts, each key is essentially a small mechanism, requiring hours of soldering. Since there are 26 letters in the alphabet, this creates long-repetitive tasks for the assembly of dozens of parts.</p>

						            <h3><strong>Rotors</strong></h3>
						            <p>The rotor assembly is the main electromechanical subsystem that carries out the encryption logic of the Enigma Machine, changing the letter 6 times as the signal passes through the combination of the 3 rotors.</p>
						            
						            <p>The rotors receive the information sent by the plugboard through recipient pins, then the letter received passes through the internal wires that connect to the spring pin in a different axial position than the recipient pin. This spring pin sends the information to the next rotors and eventually the information gets to the reflector where the signal is sent back to the rotors and is swapped again.</p>
						            
						            <p>The design is based on the Enigma rotor original architecture, however, it was modified in the early design process to match our fabrication methods, electrical wiring capabilities and mechanical constraints.</p>
						            
						            <p>One of the main changes made was to scale the rotors larger, since in one of our first prototypes the wiring space was limited to 4mm, we decided to change it to 2 cm. This allowed sufficient space for internal wiring and soldering operations, gave more leeway to align the rotors, and enabled stable integration of spring-pin contacts within our capabilities.</p>
						            
						            <p>The original idea was to use aluminum pins to be the recipient side of the rotors. However, because aluminum instantly creates an oxide layer that resists solder, a specialized flux with fluorine would be needed. For this reason, we decided to use 8 AWG copper wire to create recipient pins. The manufacturing of these pins was done by cutting the wire to the approximate desired length and then flattening the ends with a belt sander to make the surface smooth.</p>

						    <!-- Reflector -->
						    <div class="spotlight">
						        <div class="content">
						            <h3><strong>Reflector</strong></h3>
						            <p>The reflector receives the signal from the rotors and sends it back through a different rotor pin. To design the reflector, we went through an iteration to align the spacing of the reflector pins with the rotor pins and ensure a press-fit that was strong enough that the pins would not slide back when compressed, but were still able to be inserted. One change we made to the wiring was shortening the wires for a cleaner look and lower risk of them getting caught/snagged. The solder connections between pins occasionally broke. From this, we learned to solder the pins so that the solder did not interfere with the press-fit while keeping a strong connection, and added shrink-wrap to prevent shorting.</p>

						            <h3><strong>Compressor</strong></h3>
						            <p>The compressor is composed of three parts: The 3d printed housing, an aluminum nut, the threaded end of our axle, and an acrylic rectangle. The housing slides into the reflector, applying force on it and the rotors. The housing has a hole that was made to fit the nut inside. The nut was made from a ~1in block of aluminum from a free scrap bin. We decided to make the nut because m7 threaded nuts were not available in the shop and we wanted to practice machining. We cut off a ¼ inch thick rectangle with a bandsaw. The hole in the center was made with a drill-press, then threaded with an m7 tap to match the 7mm shaft. Instead of cutting it down to be hexagonal, we made a cavity in the 3d printed insert that matched the shape of the piece of aluminum we found. The end of the device's main shaft was threaded with an m7 die. About an inch and a half of the shaft was threaded so that when the nut is on the shaft, enough shaft sticks out to go through the hole in the casing that holds up and aligns the shaft.</p>
