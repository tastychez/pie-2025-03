						            <h3><strong>Keyboard</strong></h3>
						            <p>The keyboard design borrows from the original Enigma Machine. It uses spring-loaded metal rods topped with labeled key-caps. When a letter is pressed, the key completes a circuit on the breadboard which gets sent to the Arduino for processing.</p>

									<p>The original idea was to use a small length of solder wick because it was conductive and flexible. However, since solder wick oxidizes so quickly, it might become unreliable, which led us to look for more reliable solutions. We decided to use copper wire and split bushings instead.</p>
									
									<p>The first iteration we had originally had the copper pieces sticking out from the brackets at an angle. It became clear that this wouldn’t work as the springs were too stiff and required too much force to contact well. Instead of redesigning, which would have taken too much time and iteration at that stage of the process, we just glued the copper pieces on top of the brackets, as they were at a good height.</p>
									
									<p>A compromise we had to make was not using a lid. We had designed and laser-cut a lid, but with the amount of wires we had, and the non-constant key height, the lid would not fit. If we did this project again, we would have designed to be able to have a lid, which would restrain the keys from wobbling as much as they did.</p>
									
									<p>A tradeoff to making the keyboard as opposed to using a standard keyboard is time and redundancy. Since keys are made using springs and many small parts, each key is essentially a small mechanism, requiring hours of soldering. Since there are 26 letters in the alphabet, this creates long-repetitive tasks for the assembly of dozens of parts.</p>

						            <h3><strong>Rotors</strong></h3>
						            <p>The rotor assembly is the core electromechanical subsystem of the Enigma Machine, responsible for performing the encryption logic. As the signal travels through the three rotors to the reflector and back, each rotor remaps the input through its internal wiring, resulting in six successive letter substitutions. Electrically, the signal enters each rotor through recipient pins, is redirected by the internally scrambled wiring, and leaves through spring-pin contacts to the next rotor. After reaching the reflector, the signal returns through a different path, generating a second set of substitutions.</p>

									<p>The design was based on the original Enigma rotor architecture, but as development progressed, it evolved through multiple practical adaptations and original design decisions driven by fabrication methods, mechanical constraints, available components, and the project timeline.</p>
									
									<p>One of the first major adaptations was scaling the rotors. Early prototypes allowed only approximately 4 mm of space for internal wiring, which proved insufficient for reliable soldering, routing, and alignment. Increasing this space to approximately 2 cm enabled clean internal wiring, improved rotor alignment, and stable integration of spring-pin contacts within our manufacturing capabilities.</p>
									
									<p>Material selection for the recipient pins was also influenced by availability. Aluminum pins were initially considered because they were readily accessible in the shop, making them a practical early choice. However, aluminum forms an oxide layer that prevents reliable soldering without specialized fluorine-based flux. To avoid this limitation and improve electrical reliability, we transitioned to 8 AWG copper wire. The pins were fabricated by cutting the wire to length and flattening the ends with a belt sander to create smooth, consistent contact surfaces.</p>
									
									<p>The assembly process evolved alongside the design. An initial assembly sequence proved impractical due to alignment issues when installing the ratchet wheel. This led to the development of a revised method that prioritized mechanical alignment before final wiring. All 26 spring pins were first locked between the ratchet wheel and locking plate, after which wires were soldered, routed, and terminated with copper pellets and heat shrink. The wires were then scrambled according to the rotor key and enclosed within the copper housing, which was secured using three M4 screws.</p>
									
									<p>For rotor motion, we attempted to replicate the original seesaw-driven ratchet stepping mechanism. A thick driver actuated a seesaw assembly made from acrylic and 3D-printed components, converting linear motion into discrete angular rotation of the ratchet wheel. The geometry of the ratchet teeth and notched plate was redesigned to match the enlarged rotor size and pin spacing. During testing, however, we found that reliable electrical contact required greater spring-pin compression than the seesaw mechanism could provide. As a result, automatic stepping was not dependable in this iteration. To ensure consistent operation, rotor rotation was implemented manually using integrated thumb wheels, preserving functional behavior while improving reliability.</p>

						    <!-- Reflector -->
			<div>
			    <div class="content">
			        <h3><strong>Reflector</strong></h3>
			        <p>The reflector receives the signal from the rotors and sends it back through a different rotor pin. To design the reflector, we went through an iteration to align the spacing of the reflector pins with the rotor pins and ensure a press-fit that was strong enough that the pins would not slide back when compressed, but were still able to be inserted. One change we made to the wiring was shortening the wires for a cleaner look and lower risk of them getting caught/snagged. The solder connections between pins occasionally broke. From this, we learned to solder the pins so that the solder did not interfere with the press-fit while keeping a strong connection, and added shrink-wrap to prevent shorting.</p>

						            <h3><strong>Compressor</strong></h3>
						            <p>The compressor is composed of three parts: The 3d printed housing, an aluminum nut, the threaded end of our axle, and an acrylic rectangle. The housing slides into the reflector, applying force on it and the rotors. The housing has a hole that was made to fit the nut inside. The nut was made from a ~1in block of aluminum from a free scrap bin. We decided to make the nut because m7 threaded nuts were not available in the shop and we wanted to practice machining. We cut off a ¼ inch thick rectangle with a bandsaw. The hole in the center was made with a drill-press, then threaded with an m7 tap to match the 7mm shaft. Instead of cutting it down to be hexagonal, we made a cavity in the 3d printed insert that matched the shape of the piece of aluminum we found. The end of the device's main shaft was threaded with an m7 die. About an inch and a half of the shaft was threaded so that when the nut is on the shaft, enough shaft sticks out to go through the hole in the casing that holds up and aligns the shaft.</p>
