              <p><h4 id="electrical-overview">Electrical Overview</h4>
<p>The electrical system of the Fox-Bot was designed to be both functional and clean. The electrical system needs to facilitate all necessary software tasks and power all of the systems while not interfering with the cute looks of the bot. It should also be well organized and easy to follow for debugging.</p>

<p>All external interaction with the robot was to occur via audio which we pivoted on later in the project.</p>

<h4 id="initial-design-choices">Initial Design Choices</h4>
<p>Going into the team set the following electrical goals:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Clean and tidy</li>
  <li>Integrated with the mechanical system from the start</li>
  <li>Contained (does not interfere with cuteness)</li>
  <li>Sufficiently powerful to power all components without dropouts</li>
  <li>Powerful enough to run machine learning</li>
</ol>

<p>The first big choices on the table were how to do computing, how to control motors and servos, and how to power the system.</p>

<h5 id="computing-demands">Computing Demands</h5>
<p>Running both machine learning processes and audio processing at once requires a lot of computing power and powerful software available. Many Single Board Computers (SBCs) exist on the market but many are either overpriced or underperforming for our budget and needs. To compare our options we made the following decision matrix:</p>

<p><em>Note: The Arduino Uno Q would have been an absolutely perfect option but it would not have arrived in time.</em></p>

<h5 id="motorservo-control">Motor/Servo Control</h5>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 5 cannot directly control and power servos or motors so we needed an intermediate to facilitate this control. In earlier PIE projects we learned how to use Arduino’s and Adafruit Motor Shields, and since fancy motor control was not in the scope of the project or in our learning goals we opted to continue with this method of control. PIE also has a spare motor shield we could borrow which made it an easy choice given that our team also had multiple Arduino R4s are our disposal at the beginning (<em>foreshadowing</em>).</p>

<h5 id="system-power">System Power</h5>
<p>All the components we selected have to now be powered. All together, the <em>max</em> power draw of the system is as follows:</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi 5 = 15W (3A @ 5V) <br />
Arduino Uno R4 Minima = 0.5W (90mA @ 5V) <br />
Three Servos = 3W (600mA @ 5V) <br />
Two 8x8 Matrix Displays = 3W (600mA @ 5V) <br />
Two 12V Drive Motors = 72W (6A @ 12V) <br /></p>

<p><strong>Total 5V = 4.29A <em>Needs to be stepped down from 12v</em></strong> <br />
<strong>Total 12V = 2.4A <em>Including 12V converter theoretical draw</em></strong></p>

<p>We had a 12V battery easily at our disposal from PIE stock. It was a 12V 2.2AH Li-Po battery that has seen better days (<em>foreshadowing #2</em>). Also, we needed a 12V system anyway to power the motors.</p>

<p>We found buck converters in the electrical stock room that could only supply 3A max, meaning that at full draw our robot would be power limited. Also, the Raspberry Pi 5 is incredibly sensitive to power fluctuations (<em>foreshadowing #3</em>) so having a dedicated buck converter makes the system more reliable and cleaner. So we ended up with a 12V battery and 2 buck converters to power the entire robot.</p>

<h4 id="initial-workintegration">Initial Work/Integration</h4>
<p>With all of our components selected, we could start working! Our original expectation was to use three microphones for all of the software functions. To test this, we connected three microphones to the ADC port on an Arduino and transmitted the audio data over WiFi to test botha audio collection and remote data transmission. We were only able to send low fidelity audio which did not meet software’s requirements for tracking a person or melody. Relatively late into the project we switched to a camera which we will discuss more later.</p>

<p>Just as we were figuring out audio our Raspberry Pi 5 finally arrived. We purchased the Pi 5 due to it’s reliability, community, and generally available knowledge on the internet. However, we managed to discover many of the possible downfalls of the Raspberry Pi 5, all in succession.</p>

<p>After flashing a 64 bit version of Debian Trixie, the Raspberry Pi would start to boot, get caught, and start to boot again endlesssly. It gave no error code, would not connect to the internet so we could SSH into it and check errors, or give really any consistent signal as to the problem. We eventually identified a weak power supply, wires that were too thin, a slow SD card, and funky network protocols to all be interfering with the boot process.</p>

<p>After soldering thicker wires to the GPIO pins, setting a static IP and connecting to OLIN-DEVICES, finding a faster SD card, and changing power supplies the Raspberry Pi booted! This was absolutely huge for our team and happened after over ten hours of fiddling with a supposedly plug and play product. <em>Note: we did not have the Raspberry Pi official power supply which would have solved some isses.</em></p>

<h4 id="powering-the-system">Powering the System</h4>
<p>With our base systems set up with the Arduino data communication and Raspberry Pi up and running, we started to integrate the electrical system. We were able to find two buck converters in the electrical stock room that perfectly fit our power requirements and dimensions.</p>

<p>Within a couple days we had a fully wired, albeit messy, system for testing. Our battery was happily powering our buck converters and the Arduinos and motors.</p>
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%;">
    <iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r53Vig4T5lE" title="Fox-Bot Firmware" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="">
    </iframe>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Then one of our GPIO pins on the Arduino shorted and produces magic smoke and a 12V wire became quite friendly with the USB port on the other Arduino… leaving us with one final Arduino for the project.</p>

<p>Besides this, the two buck converter system kept the Raspberry Pi happy while providing enough power to the servos and displays.</p>

<h4 id="wire-management">Wire Management</h4>
<p>It was incredibly important to our electrical team member that the system be quite neat. So after we had a working prototype, it was time to refine the wiring. Before refinement the wiring was quite a rats next, it all worked but some wires were too short, some were too long, and it all made working on the robot really hard.</p>

<p>To fix this issue we unsoldered all of the wires and made all of them the correct length as well as switching to silicone sleeved wire instead of PVC for easy of routing. We then added wire wrap and head shrink to all necessary connections and routed the wires for minimal length on power wires.</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/portfolio/sleeve.jpg" alt="Fox-Bot wires in wire sleeve" width="100%" /><br /></p>

<p>Here is what the final electrical system looks like with all of the wire management.</p>

<h4 id="firmware-development">Firmware Development</h4>
<p>Firmware also fell under the electrical umbrella. Please see the firmware page on the website for details on the development.</p>

<h4 id="the-li-po-fiasco">The Li-Po Fiasco</h4>
<p>The battery powering our dear furry friend was a 12V Li-Po battery that was in PIE stock. We found it with a small amount bulge but it was within safe levels. This battery served us for a couple weeks before we left the robot plugged in all night. This completely drained the battery causing. In the morning we charged the battery again causing it to inflate a great deal more to highly unsafe levels (enough that the entire PIE teaching team was concerned). We unfortunately had to dispose of our trusty battery with the shop.</p>

<p>The PIE team offered to buy our team a new battery since safety comes above budget so huge shout out to all of them. Thank you for making our project possible. But for a while we were relegated to power supply testing for our software/hardware integration.</p>

              <p><h4 id="firmware-design-requirements">Firmware Design Requirements</h4>

<p>Our system uses an Arduino R4 Minima to facilitate actuation of servos, motors, and receiving signals. The Arduino recieves all of its instructions on how to actuate those devices via a serial message from the Raspberry Pi 5. Since we need the robot to react in real time with the user the firmare needs to be efficient and loop quickly. The firmware also needs to do very minimal calculation as most of the grunt work is done by the much more powerful Raspberry Pi 5.</p>

<h4 id="logic-walk-through">Logic Walk-Through</h4>

<p>Since everything the Arduino does is based on the data it receives, the main loop starts with reading and unpacking a serial message.</p>

<p>The serial communicaton and function calls make up the entire loop. This simple loop accomplishes our goals of simplicity and speed. This loop is able to run fast enough to react in real time (impercetable to our eyes) to the Raspberry Pi’s inputs even while changing motor, servo, and display states.</p>

<p>A huge part of the speed of the firmware is derived from non-blocking function calls. None of our functions wait for the action to be completed which greatly increases speed.</p>
<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">loop</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Serial</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">available</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="n">SERIAL_PACKET_SIZE</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This can lead to issues of actions not reaching completion before a new state is requested. We solve this problem by reducing or increasing the message rate of the Raspberry Pi as the Arduino only acts when a serial message is available. Therefore, the loop runs only as often as the Raspberri Pi requests (up until the Arduino’s computing limit).</p>

<h4 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h4>

<p>The Arduino is connected to an Adafruit v3 motor shield to allow the Arduino to control the two DC drive motors. We are also using matrix LED displays along with servos and thus we need multiple external libraries to run these complex tasks. The libraries we used are:</p>
