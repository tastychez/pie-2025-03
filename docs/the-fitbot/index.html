                The FitBot is a fitbit-like wearable arm device that tells time, takes vitals, and can send exercises for users to do. This product is designed for people with medical conditions that prevent them from standard or intense exercise but still want to work out.

                Principles of Integrated Engineering, is an interdisciplinary class taught at Olin that emphasizes the importance of teamwork and flexibility in order to complete various projects in short periods of time. In this course, students practice analysis, design, construction, testing, and debugging of real electromechanical systems. Through a substantial multidisciplinary team project experience, students will apply those skills to engineering a complete mechatronic system of their own design. Every project will include a nontrivial mechanical system design, a nontrivial electronic system design, a microcontroller, and all hardware, firmware, and software components necessary for integration. Iteration is incredibly important, as the final project must be created in approximately 6 weeks in a series of 3 2-week sprints.
