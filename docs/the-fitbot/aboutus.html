               Lexi is a passionate and driven biomedical engineer at Olin College who hopes to design life saving technologies for those whose bodies fail them in times of crisis or injury. Despite her lack of experience she took on the role as head of the electrical subteam for the FitBot project, putting her in the shoes of an electrical computing engineer. She worked with ECE Olin professors to study circuitry design and did heavy research on every component the team considered using to provide the most accurate pros and cons lists, and headed the designing the circuit and power system. She also was a part of the software team and managed the implementation of vital equations to generate readings from sensors. She is proud of the FitBot and grateful this project gave her the chance to explore different types of engineering and grew her soldering skills.
