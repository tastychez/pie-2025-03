							The build behind the beauty.

						<h2>High-Level Design & Tradeoffs</h2>
					</header>

					<h3>Project Scale</h3>
					<p>
						Our initial goal was to design a portable star tracker that could be transported and deployed by
						a single person in areas with little to no light pollution. We intentionally avoided a large,
						stationary system that would need to remain in one location or require multiple people to move.
						A smaller footprint also reduced manufacturing risk, which was important since this was the
						first machining experience for some members of the team.
					</p>

					<h3>Materials & Aesthetics</h3>
					<p>
						One of our primary goals was to produce a machined final iteration to expand our machining
						skills and present a more professional-level final product. At the same time, our design allows
						for a completely 3D-printed build, which we tested extensively during earlier iterations. This
						choice makes the system more accessible, as amateur astronomers can print the parts themselves
						and assemble their own version. For the machined version, we chose 6061 aluminum because it is
						easy to source, forgiving to machine, and stiff enough to prevent flex in the camera arm and
						drive housing, which improves long-exposure image stability.
					</p>

					<h3>Design Tradeoffs</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Printed vs. Machined Components: We kept the geometry printable during early development so
							new astronomers could replicate the system without tooling. The final version used machined
							6061 aluminum where rigidity directly improves consistency and thus image quality.</li>
						<li>Equatorial vs. Alt-Az Alignment: An equatorial mount lets us track on a single axis once
							aligned to Earth’s pole. This reduced the control problem and eliminated constant two-axis
							motion. </li>
						<li>Cycloidal Reduction vs. Planetary or Worm Gears: Cycloidal drives produce high ratios with
							smooth motion and tolerate printed tolerances. A worm gear would stall smaller steppers and
							microstepping would be too jittery.</li>
						<li>NEMA-23 Steppers Instead of Smaller Motors: Smaller motors stalled during slow micro
							stepping. NEMA-23s provided enough torque margin to avoid missed steps at 0.025deg/min
							additionally their size and density made them integrate well into the final design as
							structural components. </li>
						<li>Software Timing vs. Hardware Timing: The original GPIO control suffered from Linux jitter.
							Switching to pigpio and daemon-driven pulses fixed the timing problem and prevented step
							loss.
						</li>
						<li>Standalone Camera Control vs. Manual Shooting: Automating capture through gphoto2 reduced
							user error and allowed raw astrophotography presets instead of adjusting exposure by hand.
						</li>
						<li>One-Axis Tracking vs. Two-Axis Control: By aligning the RA axis mechanically, we avoided
							writing a continuous two-axis correction loop. That made tracking simpler and more reliable.
						</li>
						<li>Portability vs. Size/Stiffness: A small system is easier to backpack into dark fields but
							offers less mechanical rigidity. We accepted that trade-off and reinforced the final metal
							version where needed.
						</li>
						<li>Low-Cost Replication vs. Maximum Rigidity: The BOM keeps a fully printed option viable for
							under $250 while still supporting a higher-rigidity aluminum build for users with access to
							a mill.
						</li>
					</ul>

							<h3>Camera Arm & Mount</h3>
						</header>
						<div class="image featured"><img src="images/DFM Arm Assembly.png" alt="" /></div>
						<p>
							The arm and camera mount are made up of several main components. The base plate attaches
							directly to the cycloidal drive and includes a slot for the vertical arm. This vertical arm
							houses the motor as well as the gear reduction, and it supports a steel pin and bearing that
							connect to the camera mount.

							The choice to use a steel shaft was important. In early iterations, we tested a 3D-printed
							shaft, but it experienced noticeable torsional deformation due to the combined torque from
							the camera weight and the gear reduction. Switching to steel significantly improved
							stiffness and reduced twisting under load.

						</p>
						<p>
							A standard off-the-shelf bearing was added to reduce friction between the pin and the arm,
							allowing smoother rotation and reducing wear on the components. The arm plate and camera
							mount plate were made from 3/8 inch 6061 aluminum, which provided more strength than
							strictly necessary but helped ensure rigidity. This thickness was also practical because the
							material was available as leftover scrap stock, allowing us to avoid purchasing additional
							material.

							The base plate for the arm was made from 1/4 inch 6061 aluminum, which matched other
							structural components in the system and was also readily available as extra stock. Using
							materials we already had on hand helped reduce cost while keeping the overall structure
							stiff and reliable.

							<h3>Polar Alignment System</h3>
						</header>
						<div class="image featured"><img src="images/Full Assembly.png" alt="" /></div>
						<p>
							Early in the design process, we chose to pursue an equatorial mount rather than an
							alt-azimuth mount in order to achieve smoother tracking and better image quality. In an
							equatorial system, once the right ascension axis is aligned with Earth’s rotation, the
							system only needs to rotate about a single axis to track a star. This simplifies control
							compared to an alt-azimuth mount, where both motors must move continuously to follow the
							same object.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Polar Alignment System allows ATLAS to be converted into an equatorial style telescope.
							In order to achieve an equatorial mount system that could support the weight of the
							cycloidal drive and mount without interfering with the mechanisms, we decided to use a three
							leg system. Using MATLAB, calculations were performed to find the optimal attachment
							locations to support the weight of the mount and to find optimal leg lengths provided stock
							limitations and allow for inclination adjustability.
						</p>
						<p>
							In order to increase functionality and adaptability, the front leg features an adjustable
							element that allows the angle of inclination to range from 30-45 degrees. This works through
							a hollow shaft that another shaft fits into. The inner-shaft can be adjusted to change the
							front leg length and locked into place using a shaft collar. The adjustable leg is attached
							to the bottom of the cycloidal drive motor using a custom attachment part. The two back legs
							are secured through attachment blocks that are secured to the top plate of the cycloidal
							drive housing. Additionally, all legs are able to be removed by simply unscrewing the legs
							from the attachment mounts to convert the telescope to an altazimuth.

							<h3>Stellar Localization System & Programmatic Camera Control</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							The heart of ATLAS’s star tracking capabilities reside in its ability to autonomously
							capture photos for both calibration and observations. This is done thanks to the gphoto2
							library, which we chose over other solutions like digiCamControl and CHDK due to its
							modularity and (relatively) detailed documentation. Through the library, we were able to
							fully automate the photo-taking process. We also created a variety of “modes”, or specific
							configurations of the camera’s settings built to optimize the photography of specific
							astronomical objects.
							Initial calibration is handled by a series of methods we’ve called set_capture_mode,
							take_photo, plate_solver, and reset().
						</p>
						<p>
							First, we use the gphoto2 library to connect to our ATLAS’s camera, changing its settings to
							a specific mode via the set_capture_mode function. Once the connection has been established
							and the settings are to our liking, we command the camera to take a ten-second exposure
							photo via gphoto2. This photo is used for calibration, so it is imperative that during this
							time, ATLAS is aimed at a portion of the night sky with a good number of visible stars. The
							actual calibration is handled by our Plate-Solving algorithm, which works by pulling the
							.RAW calibration image off of the Camera’s SD card, converting it into a FITS file and
							comparing its metadata (camera settings, time taken, coordinates, etc) to that of various
							other images taken from seven distinct astronomical databases. Once a sufficient number of
							images similar to the calibration image have been indexed, the Plate-Solver then uses their
							asterisms to predict what objects are in them, as well as the coordinates, in Right
							Ascension and Declination, that the original image was taken at.
						</p>
						<p>
							Due to our initial plate-solving algorithm being extremely poorly optimized thanks to the many
							requests we had to send back and forth, we decided to take advantage of the Astrometry
							database’s resources to consolidate our algorithm. As a result, we merely need to provide an
							appropriate image and query for the returned coordinates—the asterism cross-referencing is
							done autonomously.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once ATLAS’ coordinates have been determined, the user can request to track any of the twenty
							million astronomical objects within the SIMBAD database, at which point the ATLAS Telescope
							will move to the specified location. Upon reaching a predetermined distance in arcminutes
							from the target, ATLAS will continually move at a speed of 0.25 degrees/minute to keep in
							alignment with Earth’s sidereal time.
						</p>
						<a href="https://github.com/systamii/Smart-Dualscope">Starglazers GitHub Repo</a>
						<p>A link to the entire ATLAS codebase can be found here. The following packages and libraries
							are required in order to run the startracker code:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>AstroPy</li>
							<li>Requests</li>

							<h3>Axial Motor Control</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							Precise control, accurate timing, and support for large loads were our main priorities for
							our integrated tracking system. Hence, we selected Nema 23s, which are bipolar stepper
							motors that offer higher torque, power efficiency, and smoother stepping compared to
							unipolar motors. The pulse and directional terminals of the DM542 Driver are wired to the
							3.3V logic GPIO pins of the raspberry pi. With the pigpio library leveraging the pi’s
							hardware timing to generate and send PWM signals to the motors, we were able to circumvent
							timing jitters and excessive CPU load. Limit switches mounted on either side of the
							declination motor also prevent collision with the camera lens.
						</p>
						<p>
							A major issue we realized after testing our integrated system was that the motors did not
							have encoders, so we could never derive the system’s previous or current position. This
							required us to manually track steps, which obviously proved to be inconvenient and
							inefficient.
						</p>
						<p>
							The DM542 drivers also require a minimum 5V input for its pulse and direction terminals.
							Since the GPIO pins of the pi only supply 3.3V, there was not enough of a voltage difference
							between the highs and lows sent to move the motors both clockwise and counterclockwise. This
							causes tangling of our wires since the right ascension motor must completely loop around
							itself to reset to its original position. With more time, we would add another circuit that
							provides adequate power to these terminals in the motor driver while connecting its logic
							back to the GPIO pins.
						</p>
						<p>
							Lastly, AC power adapters are used to power the motors since it was the most accessible
							option for rapid prototyping. If we had a greater budget, we would buy lithium batteries to
							ensure our system can also be used in remote areas, which are more desirable to avoid light
							pollution.

							In the future, to make our telescope truly user-friendly, we would implement a wireless
							bluetooth connection to the raspberry pi that allows users to input the stars they want to
							track and take pictures remotely from their personal device.
