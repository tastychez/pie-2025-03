						The brightest star in the night sky: Taken just outside of the Olin dorms, this was the
						first star photo we were able to take using the full tracking capabilities of ATLAS. This
						was taken by stitching together three ten second exposures, giving us a deeper dynamic
						range. For a stationary camera, Sirius would look blurry or even streaky due to the rotation
						of the earth. You can see that with our tracking, Sirius remains a perfect, crisp circle.

						<h3>Jupiter</h3>

						Our latest observation: We weren't really sure what we were seeing initially, but after
						plate-solving, we realized we were looking at Jupiter! Taken with a 30 second continuous
						exposure, Jupiter came out incredibly crisp and with very little noise. We were fortunate to
						be in a secluded, dark area for this one, which gave us exceptionally high contrast.

					<h2>What's The Point?</h2>
					<p>
						Our goal is to remove the barrier of entry for amateur astronomers through the design and
						manufacture of a simple star-tracking motorized camera mount designed for long exposure
						photography of astronomical objects. ATLAS consists of a motorized mounting system and a
						star-tracking algorithm that calibrates to known objects in the sky and precisely moves a
						camera
						to photograph astronomical objects through the rotation of the earth.
					</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					A key focus of this project was to increase accessibility in astrophotography. The primary
					objective
					of ATLAS was to create a low cost system that is capable of compensating for the rotation of the
					Earth to increase the accessibility of amateur astrophotographers and astronomers. ATLAS
					features an
					adaptable mount that can be used for a telescope or camera. Additionally, ATLAS is designed to
					be
					fully 3D-printable, reducing the material cost. The calibration process uses publicly available
					astronomical coordinate data in order to reduce the barrier for entry for new astronomers. By
					lowering the cost and complexity of long exposure photography, ATLAS enables more people to
					participate in observational astronomy and contribute to meaningful observations.
