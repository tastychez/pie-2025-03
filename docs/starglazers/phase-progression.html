							<h3>Phase Structure</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							The ATLAS was developed through a four step iterative process, from an initial
							sketch model
							to a machined and (literally) polished final product. This process is aligned with
							the sprint
							structure of Olin College of Engineering’s Principles of Integrated Engineering
							course and
							reflects our team’s desire to pursue an adaptable iterative design rather than
							committing
							to a single high-risk build.

						</p>

							<h3>Phase One</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							The initial design iteration consisted of a simple, 3D-printed prototype of a single
							stage cyclodial drive, driven by a servo motor. We selected a cycloidal drive
							because it offers exceptionally smooth motion, and its inherently high gear ratio
							made it well suited for precise tracking. While this version did not include a
							camera mounting mechanism, it demonstrated that the cycloidal drive design
							functioned appropriately and provided sufficient confidence to proceed through to
							the next iteration without a significant investment in time or materials.
						</p>
						<p>
							Computationally, Phase 1 focused heavily on the development of the software needed for ATLAS
							to locate and
							track a stellar object. This was done by way of a Plate-Solving algorithm, which
							compares asterisms on a reference image populated with astronomical objects to other
							images from various astronomical databases in order to determine where the center of
							the reference image is located in the Equatorial coordinate plane. Due to our
							initial plate-solving algorithm being extremely unoptimized thanks to the many
							requests we had to send back and forth, we decided to take advantage of the
							Astrometry database’s resources to consolidate our algorithm. Thanks to this, we
							merely need to provide an appropriate image and query for the returned
							coordinates—the asterism cross-referencing is done autonomously. hen ATLAS’
							coordinates have been determined, the user can request to track any of the twenty
							million astronomical objects within the SIMBAD database, at which point the ATLAS
							Telescope will move to the specified location. Once on target, ATLAS will
							continually move at a speed of 0.25 degrees/minute to keep in alignment with Earth’s
							sidereal time.

							<h3>Phase Two</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							The second design iteration fully integrated the NEMA-23 stepper motors planned for
							the final system into a two-stage cycloidal gear system, a functioning belt system,
							and a camera mount. The two-stage cycloidal system consists of stacked 1:18 and 1:10
							cycloidal drives, which step down the motor a total of 1:180. This extreme reduction
							allows for precise movements to reduce any potential disruptions during
							long-exposure photography. However, this design iteration was not designed for
							manufacturability and lacked the structural rigidity required for reliable tracking.
							During this sprint, we decided to pivot to an equatorial mount through the
							integrating of a three-leg system that attached directly to the cycloidal drive
							housing with an adjustable front-leg to allow for elevation adjustments ranging from
							30-45 degrees. This mount style allowed us to use a smaller reduction rate of 5:1 on
							the declination axis, since precise movements were no longer needed.
						</p>
						<p>
							Both motors
							were powered by two, separate AC adapters and controlled by discrete signals sent
							from the Raspberry Pi using the RPi.GPIO library. Testing revealed that stalling of
							the motors and inaccurate timing resulted from the use of the Linux OS system. The
							second design iteration also outlined the implementation of the programmatic control
							of a camera, so as to allow ATLAS to calibrate itself and capture photos of the
							stars without human intervention. This required the use of the gphoto2 library,
							which we chose due to its modularity and (relatively) detailed documentation.
							Through the library, we were able to fully automate the photo-taking process. We
							also created a variety of “modes”, or specific configurations of the camera’s
							settings built to optimize the photography of specific astronomical objects. We
							encountered a variety of issues while trying to integrate this into our workflow,
							particularly with the gphoto2 error “[-110: I/O In Progress]”. Through rigorous
							debugging, we were able to determine that the issue arose from the camera’s shutter
							speed, which shaped how we handled setting optimization going forward.

							<h3>Phase Three</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							The third iteration focused heavily on design for manufacturing. This involved
							slimming down wall thicknesses to better mimic metal stock and redesigning most
							components so they could be produced on the mill or lathe. This phase revealed
							several key issues, particularly with camera orientation and the tolerancing of the
							cycloidal drive, which informed changes for the final design. Throughout the third
							phase, the brunt of the software changes came from optimizing the movement of the
							two NEMA-23 motors. We pivoted to the pigpio library which utilizes Daemon software
							to send PWM signals to the motors for precise timing by handling direct hardware
							communication. Our telescope now moves along one “axis” at a time.

							<h3>Phase Four</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							The final iteration was the most challenging. From a machining standpoint, the team
							had varying levels of experience, which required us to adapt, communicate clearly,
							and work closely together to complete the parts. These components also needed to
							integrate seamlessly with the electrical system; if tolerances were incorrect, we
							would have needed to pivot back to a fully 3D-printed final version. While we
							encountered a few machining mishaps, donated stock allowed us to machine the
							majority of the star tracker and complete the final assembly. Limit switches were
							also added to prevent the camera from colliding with the tilt motor mounted directly
							below it. The star tracking algorithm was also iterated upon, improving its success
							rate by capturing RAW images as opposed to JPEGs, before converting them into FITS
							files for cleaner processing. More preset capture modes were added and validated
							with real-life testing, where we compiled long-exposure images of ( Betelgeuse ) and
							( Rigel ).
