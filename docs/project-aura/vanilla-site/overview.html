              <div class="text-content">
                <p>
                  Our design process felt like a sprint up a steep hill. We knew
                  from the start that even our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) was pushing it, so the only way
                  to make progress was to move quickly, test ideas often, and
                  follow whatever paths created the least friction. We got each
                  subsystem working on its own first, almost like scattered puzzle
                  pieces, and then slowly brought them together into a single
                  system. There were plenty of moments when we disagreed about the
                  final design and couldn't settle on one direction, but each time
                  we returned to the MVP to figure out what was truly necessary.
                  If something didn't help us reach that minimal goal, we let it
                  go.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Money pushed us to be creative too. Even after adding some of
                  our own funds, we still couldn't afford certain parts like a
                  LiDAR. We borrowed one, struggled with its integration with our
                  cart, and were eventually lucky enough to borrow a depth camera
                  from another team that better suited our needs.

                  <h3>Why ROS?</h3>
                </div>
                <p>We chose ROS 2 as the core software framework because it provides a robust, scalable foundation for robotics development while remaining fully open-source. ROS 2 naturally supports a publisher–subscriber architecture, which allows sensors, controllers, and behaviors to run as independent nodes that communicate through well-defined topics.

                  Using ROS 2 gave us several key advantages:
                  
                  Modularity: Each subsystem (vision, motor control, joystick input, safety checks) runs as its own node, making debugging and iteration much easier.
                  
                  Collaboration & Parallel Development: Multiple developers can work on separate nodes without interfering with each other.
                  
                  Networking Support: ROS 2 allows seamless communication between the Raspberry Pi on the robot and a development laptop over a network, enabling remote monitoring, debugging, and visualization.
                  
                  Simulation & Visualization: Built-in support for tools like RViz and Gazebo allows us to visualize sensor data and robot behavior before deploying changes to hardware.
                  
                  Scalability: The same software structure can scale from simple teleoperation to fully autonomous behavior without major redesign.
                  
                  The Raspberry Pi 4B runs the full ROS 2 stack and serves as the central compute unit, handling sensor input, control logic, and actuator commands.</p>

                  <h3>Why Front Wheel Swerve Drive?</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                  We chose to implement a front wheel swerve drive because it
                  provides a highly mobile, technically challenging drivetrain.
                  While we could have chosen to do front wheel steering with
                  rear wheel drive, it would have caused lower maneuverability
                  and difficulty retaining traction. A swerve drive also allows
                  us to perform steering with Ackermann in mind. Ackermann is a
                  characteristic in which one wheel steers less than the other,
                  which helps improve maneuverability and reduces slippage.
                  Having both drive and steer in the front also posed an
                  exciting challenge to us for packaging and integration. It
                  forced us to design mindfully and caused some unforeseen
                  challenges later on that made us rethink a lot of parts.

                  <h3>Why Depth Camera?</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                  We chose a depth camera over a 360-degree LiDAR because we
                  couldn't find a good way to mount the LiDAR where it could
                  actually see everything around the cart. The best we could do
                  was place it in the front, which would have limited it to
                  about 180 degrees of coverage. On top of that, the LiDAR we
                  had access to was older and much harder to work with. It
                  needed PoE and a more complicated setup, while the depth
                  camera (a RealSense) connected cleanly over USB-C and already
                  had a ROS2 integration we could use right away. The existing
                  ROS2 publisher made it simple to get depth data streaming, so
                  the depth camera ended up being the most practical choice for
                  our system.

                  <h3>Why switch from UWB to camera for human following</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                  We originally relied on UWB modules for human-following, but
                  the system struggled in real environments. The estimated
                  position would drift even when the person wasn't moving, and
                  accuracy broke down whenever the robot approached certain
                  angles. Metal components on the robot reflected the UWB signal
                  heavily, and other parts blocked line-of-sight altogether,
                  making the ranging data noisy and unreliable. After extensive
                  calibration, filtering, and controlled testing, the
                  limitations were still too severe for consistent tracking.
                  This led us to pivot to a computer-vision approach using
                  reflective tape, which provides stable, front-facing detection
                  without the environmental interference that plagued UWB.
