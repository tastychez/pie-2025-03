                The electrical system originally began with three voltages: 24V,
                12V, and 5V. We later simplified the design after realizing the
                12V rail was unnecessary because we were no longer using the 12V
                lidar. All high-power components could run directly from the 24V
                battery, and the low-power devices did not require a dedicated
                5V supply. Instead, we used a high-wattage power bank, which
                provided an integrated BMS and safely powered the Raspberry Pi,
                USB camera, and UWB modules. This reduced complexity and
                increased system safety.

                <li>
                  <strong>24V system:</strong> Breakers were sized slightly
                  above the continuous current draw of each motor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>5V system:</strong> All 5V devices were powered
                  through the Raspberry Pi, which was connected to a
                  high-wattage power bank.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Mounting:</strong> 3D printed C-clamps secured the
                  electrical system to the underside of the cart.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Power distribution:</strong> Wago connectors were used
                  on power lines to make it easy to isolate and test individual
                  components.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Data lines:</strong> Soldered connections were used
                  because communication signals are more sensitive and require
                  reliable joints.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Prototyping:</strong> We transitioned from solderless
                  breadboards to soldered boards to improve robustness during
                  testing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cable management:</strong> Velcro zip ties were used
                  to organize and bundle wiring.

                  <h3>Emergency stop did not fully cut power</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                  We did not realize that the GPIO ground on the drive
                  controller was shared with the controller's main power ground.
                  Our emergency stop only disconnected part of the system, which
                  caused unsafe behavior and resulted in the robot hitting a
                  wall.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                <p>
                  We redesigned the grounding so there was only one ground
                  connection. This ensured that activating the emergency stop
                  fully disconnected both power and ground, shutting down the
                  entire drive system safely.

                </div>
                <p>
                  Wires on the Raspberry Pi and breadboard would frequently come
                  loose while the robot was running. This made it difficult to
                  tell whether problems were caused by software bugs or
                  electrical failures.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                <p>
                  We secured critical connections using hot glue and reduced
                  movement in the wiring. This made the system far more stable
                  and eliminated many false software debugging sessions.

                  <h3>Hard to debug electronics versus software issues</h3>
                </div>
                <p>
                  Our early setup used solderless breadboards and unlabeled
                  wires, which made it unclear whether failures were caused by
                  bad code or poor electrical connections.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                <p>
                  We created a clear step by step debugging procedure and relied
                  on a multimeter to check voltages and signals directly instead
                  of guessing based on code behavior alone.

                </div>
                <p>
                  As the system grew, it became hard to tell which wire
                  connected to which component. Tracing wires took a lot of time
                  and increased the risk of mistakes.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                <p>
                  We labeled every wire, created a clear electrical diagram with
                  defined pin inputs and outputs, and zip tied and mounted wires
                  to the board to keep them organized and away from moving parts
                  like the wheels.
