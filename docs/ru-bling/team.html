          <p id="role-1" class="role">Project Manager & Electrical Lead</p>
          <p class="bio">Always physically with us, even while deep in a tangle of wires and circuits, Antara was the backbone of our team in every sense. She was constantly leading, checking in, problem solving, and keeping the project moving forward when it mattered most. She is quite literally the reason we were able to bring this project to completion. Rubling would simply not exist without her leadership or her ability to make sense of wires the rest of us were afraid to touch.</p>

          <p class="bio">The girl who never sleeps, Navya's Joji playlist got us through our pre-Demo Day all-nighter. RIP to the two sacrificed SD cards that were simply not worthy of Navya's all-powerful Raspi code that controlled every part of Rubling from user input to arduino comms to the blingy display. </p>

          <p class="bio">Ammara didn't think she could finish it all in time, but we believed in her. Countless nights of working in the Foundry, tens of hours of track-pad CAD-ing and a 45 minute discussion on colors later, Ammara designed a maze of pulleys, lead screws and acrylic that was by far the coolest of all.</p>
