    <h2>Demo Day</h2>
    On Demo Day, Wednesday, December 17, 2025, our project finally came to fruition.
    <h3>What worked?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cube solver</strong> - it was able to obtain the correct configuration with 100% accuracy</li>
      <li><strong>User input</strong> - all touch srceen buttons responded and worked as expected to allow the user to follow instrcutions and interact with the solver </li>
      <li><strong>Almost all of it!</strong> The project was able to fulfill its main goal of having a solver that solves a cube to a target pattern using user input. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What didn't work as well?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cube motor detachment system</strong> - the force generated by the secondary motors and pulley was simply not strong enough to push the motor with the cube inserts fully into the cube.
      To get around this, we manually moved the motors into place and used a rubber band to hold the cube motors in place together while the solver ran.</li>
      <li><strong>Rack-and-Pinion</strong> - we had aimed to have a rack-and-pinion pusher to push the solved cube off of the solver once it was done. 
        However, this did not end up working out due to lack of time for testing </li>
    </ul>
