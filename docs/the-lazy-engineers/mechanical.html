        <div style="margin-top:12px" class="panel">Our Ground Station <br> <br>This image is the final assembly for our ground station. It is entirly 3d printed. It features holdings for 
        two stepper motors, a raspberry pi, a lithium battery, two stepper motor drivers, a portable charger, and our camera.
        Our orginal model only consisted of a x and y stepper motor holder. This made the design very messy, and led to limited
        rotation ability in our ground station as wires were getting caught or resisting to be bent, especially the HDMI cable.
        To mitigate this I made holdings for the drivers, and made cut outs on compartment covers to guide where the wires go, and the covers also 
        let the design be much more clean as it hid wires. We also originally had the Raspberry Pi on the bottom of the design,
        but we found the camera cable length to be a limiting factor, so we put it on top so it also stays right next to the camera 
        holder and moves with it. I also decided to put in a lithium battery in our design to clean it even more, compared to before
        our stepper motors were powered by a power supply from the wall. </div>

        then covers the right compartment of the x-stepper-holder part, and comes with a hole

        <div style="margin-top:12px" class="panel">Reciever Assembly <br> <br>This is the model of our main reciever. The model allows us to insert our convex lens into the circle of the reciever
        with a press fit down, and includes holes in the corners of the circle to allow for the wiring of our two LEDs. The box is 
        wider on one side of the circle to allow for extra space to store the battery that powers our LEDs as well. Our original model 
        had multiple design flaws. It lacked holes for wires for our IR leds, which made it wiring very messy as the wires went around the box. 
        To fix this I added holes in the corners of our main circle where the IR LEDs would go. Also our original design had the lens
        slide into a tight compartment rather than being press fitted down by closing the cover on it. These risked damaging the lens
        as you slid it in, which we wanted to prevent with our new design. Lastly, to improve the design I made the extra space for the battery
        to limit messy wiring outside the box. </div>
