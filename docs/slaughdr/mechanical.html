                        <h3>Initial Design Process</h3>
                        <p>
                            The first step in designing our drone was determining the total system weight, since this
                            directly defines the lift requirements and the propeller diameter necessary for stable
                            flight. To estimate a realistic target weight, we compiled a list of all major components:
                            the drone body, structural arms, and all onboard electronics including the Nvidia Jetson,
                            Pixhawk flight controller, battery, RC receiver, voltage distribution board, telemetry
                            radio, motors, and ESCs. Because our motors and ESCs were obtained early into the design
                            process, we were able to use their performance data to guide our thrust calculations.

                        <h3>Sketches</h3>
                        <p>Before getting into detailed CAD, we made a few sketches of different drone body shapes to
                            see what could fit our components best. After trying several ideas, we chose a “coffin”
                            shaped body because it used the internal space the most efficiently and let us keep the
                            center of gravity close to the middle. </p>

                        <h3>Initial Body CAD</h3>
                        <p>
                            Once we had the general layout, we began making the CAD model of the drone body. While doing
                            this, we focused on a few main things: keeping the body strong but lightweight, making sure
                            the components fit without crowding each other, and serviceability. We designed the top
                            plate to be removable so we could quickly access the Jetson, Pixhawk, and all the wiring
                            when needed. We also added rubber gasketing and isolation features around sensitive
                            electronics to reduce vibration from the motors during flight. For stability, we decided to
                            mount the battery underneath the drone. Lowering the battery, which is 835g, more than a
                            third of our overall weight budget, shifts the center of gravity down, which makes the drone
                            more stable in flight.

                        <h3>Motor Mounts</h3>
                        <p>For the arms, we used carbon fiber tubes because they're light, rigid, and we already had
                            them available. We designed a custom hub that uses friction and a retaining bolt to hold the
                            arms tightly so they don’t wiggle or rotate during sudden maneuvers. This also helped keep
                            the propellers aligned properly with the motors .The hub was also designed so that each arm
                            can sit flush against a set surface, helping us position the propeller centers as close to
                            the drone’s overall center of gravity as possible.</p>

                            To make sure the drone can handle vibration and repeated use, we used heat-set inserts in
                            the 3D-printed parts so screws would hold better. We also used Loctite on important
                            fasteners so they wouldn’t loosen during flight.

                        <p>
                            We added simple landing gear to protect the bottom of the drone, especially the battery
                            since it hangs underneath the body. The landing gear helps absorb harder landings, and we
                            designed it to be strong enough to handle those forces without adding unnecessary height.
                            The feet extend just slightly below the battery so the drone stays low to the ground, which
                            reduces stress on the gear while still keeping the battery safely protected.

                        <p>
                            This marked the end of the first draft completed design of our drone chassis. From here we
                            decided to gather real testing data to be able to determine any further necessary changes
                            before our final redesign and fabrication process. To do this we printed out the drone
                            chassis out of abs filament in the stratasys printers and wired everything to get the drone
                            flying. Once flying we figured out that the landing gear was far too weak, the battery was
                            not secured enough, and the drone body gets extremely hot with all of the electrical
                            components heating up within it, especially after longer flight tests. To solve these issues
                            we went back to the CAD designs.
