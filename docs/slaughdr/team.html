                            Learning Goal: Learn drone control schemes and math via mathematical research and coding and
                            integrate electrically at a systematic level by understanding the entire electrical system.
                            <br><br>
                            Reflection: I didn't get to do as much with drone control schemes as I had hoped. Almost all
                            of it was handled by the flight controller. However, I reached an excellent understanding of
                            the entire integrated electrical systems. At the end of the project, I can describe the
                            exact voltage levels and use for every wire in the drone off the top of my head. Electrical
                            and software integration was much easier because of this. Additionally, I learned a lot
                            about drone coding and the mavpylink library as well as the opencv library. I wasn’t
                            expecting to learn this much on the software end, so it was a pleasant surprise. As the
                            electrical systems were finished fairly early on in the project scale, I had a lot of time
                            to work on software. I ended up being the one to integrate all of the separate software
                            systems (cv and drone control), which required a systematic understanding of software as
                            well. I wish I had the opportunity to do more with drone control schemes, although this
                            would probably have resulted in an overscoped project. Overall, I’m very happy with my
                            contributions and the final product.

                            Learning Goals: Learn how to collaboratively design mechanical systems. Learn how to CAD
                            complicated systems. Further software skills through implementing computer vision with drone
                            control.

                            Reflection: I had wanted to do mechanical engineering work since I haven't done much so far,
                            however, a drone is a very software/ electrical heavy project. I was able to design a few
                            components like the landing gear and the cooling vents, where I learned how to utilize
                            onShape more effectively like using offset planes and directional extrusions. I ended up
                            doing a lot of electrical work which was still interesting and I became better at soldering
                            and understanding how electrical systems work. I successfully furthered my software skills
                            by doing some work with the YOLO model. Overall, I learned about integration to a great
                            extent and how each system communicates with each other, as well as how to work
                            collaboratively with other people to design and build a project and am very satisfied with
                            what I’ve learned during this project

                            electrical and mechanical systems.

                            Reflection: I was able to practice writing the computer vision software and then was also
                            able to transfer to focusing on the website. Both fulfilled my desire to learn more
                            software/programming skills. YOLOv11 was new to me and learning to work with it not only
                            helped me understand the library but also its dependencies and also Python in general. And I
                            also had an extra fun sidequest learning Blender!

                            Reflection: Through a lot of the mechanical design process of making this drone, I was able
                            to work on ensuring engineering justification for designs. I went to great lengths to ensure
                            each of my parts (propeller hub and wing guard) had great reason for how it looked and how
                            it was designed. I was also able to gain a lot of experience in electrical-mechanical
                            integrations with how tight the constraints were in mounting and spacing for electrical
                            components. Overall I am very happy with the work I was able to put into this project and
                            with all of the lessons I learned as I went through the design, integration, and iteration
                            of this project.
