      <h3>Microcontroller</h3>
      <p>
        The Raspberry Pi Pico is the heart of our system. This very small 21x51mm form factor RP2040 had barely enough power to handle our 
        entire system. The RP2040 has a dual-core design, which we take advantage of to *read sensor data*(link to firmware-electrical) and 
        *drive linear actuators*(link to firmware-mechanical) at the same time. This dual-core design is also taken advantage of to run 
        *TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers on the Pico, so it just barely has enough computational power to also run our TCN*(link to 
        firmware-software).

      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p> We began the mechanical process by researching what current technologies exist to do what we are trying to do. 
        After speaking to some companies working in this sector, we came to a few conclusions about what would make a good product:</p>

    <div class="research-list">
    <section class="system-diagrams">
      <ul>
        <li> Users prefer lightweight and easy to operate over almost every other quality, making something extremely technically advanced suboptimal. </li>
        <li> Since this is meant to be a transitional system to be used while people are recovering, long term reliability is only important if 
        multiple users plan to use it.</li>
        <li>Instead of trying to cover every grip, it is much more effective to have a few key grips that are able to perform a majority of daily tasks. </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    </div>

    <div class = "research2">
    <section class="system-diagrams">
    <p>With this in mind, we started designing our first design, using 3 linear actuators, some string, and some rubber bands. Since then we have 
        continued doing research to develop a final product.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Actuation System</h3>
        <p class="more">
          The most critical part of the design was the actuation system.I used linear actuators going to a cable drive system on the 
          face of the hand. We chose to use linear actuators because it was the easiest motion to use to curl the fingers.

        <h3 class="title">Flexion System</h3>
        <p class="more">
          Flexion System: To complement the actuation system, I also created a flexion system. Its purpose was to counteract 
          the linear actuator, bringing the hand back to rest after the actuator returns itself to neutral.

          Along with the main system, I also developed mounting systems to attach needed hardware to the fingers, wrist, forearm, bicep, and wrist.

          This is the default zero-grip, all fingers are at rest (not straight, due to that causing discomfort). Whenever it is not actively

      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
      <p> If this project is continued beyond this class, there are a few large mechanical changes that could vastly improve results. 
        The first would be purchasing a slightly longer linear actuator with an encoder. The issue that we ran into was that our linear actuator 
        was slightly too short, but the next step up was too long (since they didn’t have encoders, we couldn’t stop it part way). Having encoders
         would allow us to stop it at variable distances and get how much torque the motor was using, allowing us to do more impressive things like
        having more gentle grips for certain delicate objects. </p>
        <p>
        Another change that would be implemented is changing the elastic material used, as well as the driving material. I chose to use rubber 
        bands as my elastic material to counteract cable drive, which posed problems with tensioning and wear over time. It would have been a 
        better choice to use a more reliable material that would be able to sustain continuous use. Along with this, I would buy more expensive 
        materials to create a more compliant product by making more pleasant surfaces, making it more convenient to wear.
