      <h1>Mechanical Design</h1>
      <p>
        The mechanical system of MyoAmp translates electrical muscle signals into controlled, repeatable hand motion.
        The design prioritizes modularity, durability, and user comfort while enabling multiple functional grips.

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        The goal of the mechanical system of MyoAmp was to create the actual orthotic system to integrate electrical parts onto the users. 
        This was done in a few parts: integrating boards and power electronics (bicep mount and battery mount), integrating driving system 
        (forearm and wrist mount), and integrating onto hand (finger mounts). We wanted to create an orthotic system that could easily be 
        fit to users dimensions and needs, as well as create a system that could successfully counteract cable drive with minimal 
        interference and discomfort.

      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p> We began the mechanical process by researching what current technologies exist to do what we are trying to do. 
        After speaking to some companies working in this sector, we came to a few conclusions about what would make a good product:</p>

    <section class="system-diagrams">
      <ul>
        <li> Users prefer lightweight and easy to operate over almost every other quality, making something extremely technically advanced suboptimal. </li>
        <li> Since this is meant to be a transitional system to be used while people are recovering, long term reliability is only important if 
        multiple users plan to use it.</li>
        <li>Instead of trying to cover every grip, it is much more effective to have a few key grips that are able to perform a majority of daily tasks. </li>

          The most critical part of the design was the actuation system.I used linear actuators going to a cable drive system on the 
          face of the hand. We chose to use linear actuators because it was the easiest motion to use to curl the fingers.

          Flexion System: To complement the actuation system, I also created a flexion system. Its purpose was to counteract 
          the linear actuator, bringing the hand back to rest after the actuator returns itself to neutral.

      <h3>Design Iteration & CAD</h3>
      <p>
        Multiple CAD iterations were created to refine finger articulation, actuator placement,
        and overall ergonomics. Rapid prototyping allowed the team to quickly test mechanical assumptions
        and incorporate feedback into subsequent designs.

    <section class="next">
      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
      <p> If this project is continued beyond this class, there are a few large mechanical changes that could vastly improve results. 
        The first would be purchasing a slightly longer linear actuator with an encoder. The issue that we ran into was that our linear actuator 
        was slightly too short, but the next step up was too long (since they didn’t have encoders, we couldn’t stop it part way). Having encoders
         would allow us to stop it at variable distances and get how much torque the motor was using, allowing us to do more impressive things like
        having more gentle grips for certain delicate objects. </p>
        <p>
        Another change that would be implemented is changing the elastic material used, as well as the driving material. I chose to use rubber 
        bands as my elastic material to counteract cable drive, which posed problems with tensioning and wear over time. It would have been a 
        better choice to use a more reliable material that would be able to sustain continuous use. Along with this, I would buy more expensive 
        materials to create a more compliant product by making more pleasant surfaces, making it more convenient to wear.
