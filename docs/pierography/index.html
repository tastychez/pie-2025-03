  <h3>PIErography</h3>
  <blockquote>PIErography is a 3-axis GRBL-controlled CNC pyrography machine that burns vector designs into wood using a heated tip</blockquote>

  <h2>Data and Energy Flow</h2>

  <h3>Data and Energy Flow Diagram</h3>
  <img src="media/power_flow.png" alt="Data and Energy Flow Diagram">
  <h3>Power Distribution</h3>
    <p>
    Most of the power in the system is distributed through the proto board. The power supply provides
    <strong>24 V</strong>, and the <strong>3 motor drivers</strong> connect to it via the proto board. During use, we usually
    saw around <strong>0.54 A</strong> being drawn, giving us around <strong>13 W</strong> total supplied from the power source to
    the stepper motor drivers.
  </p>

  <p>
    The drivers then regulate up to around <strong>2 A per motor phase</strong> with that higher supply, resulting in a
    lower effective coil voltage (around <strong>3 to 5 V</strong>) and an average power draw of around
    <strong>4–10 W per motor</strong>, depending on load and motion. <strong>10 W</strong> is more of an upper limit; during typical
    use, it is closer to <strong>4–5 W each</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The computer powers the Arduino separately via USB connection, sending roughly <strong>1–2 W</strong>
    (<strong>5 V</strong> × <strong>0.1–0.25 A</strong>). The wood-burning tool also has its own supply, providing
    <strong>27 W</strong> of power.
  </p>

  <h3>Control and Data Flow</h3>
  <p>
    The computer also sends and receives commands and data to/from the Arduino through the same USB cable.
    The Arduino then connects to most other components, since it is the controller of the system. It sends
    commands to all <strong>3 stepper motor drivers</strong>, telling them which direction to move, how quickly, and how
    far. The drivers convert those commands into regulated coil currents and send them to the stepper motors.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>3 limit switches</strong> send data back to the Arduino; when a switch is triggered, it trips an alarm in
    the code.
  </p>

<section id="software">
   <h2>Software</h2>

  <h3>GRBL and UGS Control</h3>
  <p>
    Our system runs on GRBL, controlled by UGS. The first thing we had to do was download
    GRBL’s open-source git repository, and flash it onto an Arduino Uno. We learned that it
    was designed for more basic models, like the Uno, after originally trying to use an R4
    and proving unsuccessful.
  </p>

  <p>
    For our interface, we used Universal G-code Sender, another free open-source software.
    UGS allowed us to send commands to the Arduino to do a few different things. We could
    write G-code to control the motor movements, or send commands to check and edit certain
    settings.
  </p>

  <p>
    UGS also has some other quality-of-life features, such as a simple ‘jogging’ control
    that allows for easy, controlled movements in one direction at a time, which was great
    for testing, debugging, and calibration.
  </p>

  <h3>Motor Calibration and Tuning</h3>
  <p>
    To calibrate our motors to our program, we moved the motors a certain distance, then
    measured the physical distance travelled. We compared how far it had actually moved
    to how far it believed it had moved (the number shown on-screen).
  </p>

  <p>
    We then divided that actual by the expected and multiplied it by the previous setting
    for ‘steps per mm’. We sent a command reassigning that value, and tested again to make
    sure it was calibrated well.
  </p>

  <p>
    We also tried setting various speeds and accelerations, to see what would be efficient
    without compromising functionality and accuracy. These were all set through UGS’s
    command terminal, with fairly simple commands like
    <code>$100=79.8</code> (setting the steps per mm of the x-axis motor to 79.8).
  </p>

  <h3>Generating G-code from Images</h3>
  <p>
    There are a few different ways to generate g-code from images. The way we first tried
    wasn’t very efficient and a bit difficult to use. First, we’d vectorize an image in a
    program like Adobe Illustrator, tweaking settings to try and get the cleanest, most
    accurate lineart we could.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then, we’d save that .svg file and open it in another program that could convert vectors
    to g-code, such as Inkscape (I do not recommend using Inkscape, it was difficult and
    frustrating). We’d change some settings, such as “tool shape” and “penetration depth”,
    as if it were a mill.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then, we could create our g-code, save it, and open it in UGS.
  </p>

  <p>
    We then pivoted to using Fusion. In Fusion, the image can be imported directly and used
    to generate an engraver toolpath within the manufacturing workspace, eliminating the
    need for an external vector to g-code software.
  </p>

  <p>
    By selecting an engraving operation and defining parameters such as tool geometry,
    cutting depth, and feed rate, Fusion automatically generates a clean, efficient
    toolpath. The resulting g-code can then be exported and opened directly in UGS.
  </p>

  <h3>Software Tests</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Connection &amp; streaming:</strong> Verified reliable USB connection and stable G-code streaming in UGS without dropped commands.</li>
    <li><strong>Jog consistency:</strong> Repeated jog moves to confirm direction correctness and repeatability on each axis.</li>
    <li><strong>Axis scaling:</strong> Commanded known moves and measured travel; tuned <code>$100</code>, <code>$101</code>, and <code>$102</code> until scaling was accurate.</li>
    <li><strong>Speed/acceleration sweep:</strong> Increased feed and acceleration settings until missed steps or quality loss occurred, then backed off to a stable operating point.</li>
    <li><strong>End-to-end test burn:</strong> Generated an engraving toolpath in Fusion, exported G-code, and executed in UGS to confirm the full pipeline.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Circuit Design</h2>
  <p>
    The power supply’s positive and negative terminals connect to the proto board in order to power the
    TB6600 stepper motor drivers. Wires run from the <strong>GND</strong> terminal of each driver to the power supply
    negative, and the driver <strong>VCC</strong> terminals connect to the power supply positive.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each stepper motor connects to its respective driver using the <strong>A+</strong>, <strong>A−</strong>, <strong>B+</strong>, and <strong>B−</strong>
    terminals. The driver supplies the motors with regulated coil currents to execute motion commands.
  </p>

  <p>
    The driver <strong>Signal</strong> terminals are used for connections to the Arduino. Each driver has
    <strong>PUL+</strong> and <strong>PUL−</strong>: <strong>PUL+</strong> connects to the Arduino <strong>step pulse</strong> pins
    (<strong>D2–D4</strong> in GRBL) and <strong>PUL−</strong> connects to Arduino ground. Each driver also has <strong>DIR+</strong> and
    <strong>DIR−</strong>: <strong>DIR+</strong> connects to the Arduino <strong>direction</strong> pins (<strong>D5–D7</strong> in GRBL) and
    <strong>DIR−</strong> connects to Arduino ground.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because all components that interface with the Arduino also need a shared ground reference, the Arduino
    <strong>GND</strong> is routed to a dedicated row on the proto board. This provides a common ground node for all
    driver signal returns and switch connections. Together, these connections allow motion control through
    the computer software (UGS) using GRBL G-code.
  </p>

  <p>
    The micro limit switches connect to both Arduino pins and ground. They are wired as
    <strong>normally closed (NC)</strong> for safety and improved robustness against electrical noise. The
    <strong>COM</strong> terminals connect to the Arduino ground row, and the <strong>NC</strong> terminals connect to the Arduino
    <strong>limit switch</strong> pins (<strong>D9</strong>, <strong>D10</strong>, and <strong>D12</strong> in GRBL).

  <h2>Mechanical Aspects</h2>

  <p class="mechanical-intro">
    The mechanical design prioritizes rigidity, repeatability, and ease of assembly. All CAD was developed in Onshape, which allowed the team
    to iterate quickly. The frame provides a stable reference plane for consistent burns, while
    belt-driven X and Y axes enable fast planar motion. A lead-screw Z axis was used to control burn depth and maintain consistent tool contact
    with the workpiece. Components were intentionally designed to be modular to support iteration, including swapping motors, re-tensioning
    belts, and adjusting the tool mount. Parts were fabricated using a combination of 3D printing and laser cutting, with structural elements
    cut using band saws and horizontal band saws to achieve accurate lengths and clean edges.

    <h3>X-Axis</h3>

    <div class="mech-main">
      <div class="mech-text">
        <p><strong>Design Concepts:</strong></p>

        <p>
          For our x-axis, we started out with the basic idea of having an idler pulley on one side and a stepper motor driving the pulley on the other side. We wanted to attach the pen holder to the belt so that it would move along the x-axis as the motor moved the belt. To make sure that it would be secure, we added the mounts for the rail.
        </p>

        <p>
          We were originally planning on having each side supported by the same linear slide, but we found that each rail introduced a lot of friction into our y-axis movements, so we changed to a slider that mounted onto the extrusion. This made it so that we had to change the base of the mount so that it would be able to fit on the new slider.
        </p>

        <p>
          We extended the slots for the motor to allow it to slide back and forth. This would allow us to tension the belt. We also added a wall on the side with a screw hole in it which would allow space for a press plate that could be screwed in or loosened to apply more or less pressure to the side of the motor, for tensioning.
        </p>

        <p>
          When we tested the early versions of the x-axis, we had the motor and the idler pulley much lower down and they were at the edge of the mount. To make the spacing work better with the z-axis, we had to move the pulleys higher and further in. As a result, we found that we needed much more support in a lot of key areas when testing our design.
        </p>

        <p>
          The tension from the belt was causing the idler pulley support to bend inwards and we were worried that the axle it was on would snap. We also noticed that when we would push on one side, the other side would lag behind slightly, resulting in a noticeable gap when the side we were pushing on would reach the end of the y-axis.
        </p>

        <p>
          We figured that this was a result of the shallow supports for the rail as well as the pliability of the 3D prints. We also noticed that moving the motor in made supporting the face it was mounted to much more difficult since there was a screw hole right next to the motor’s side. Since the other side of the motor hung out over the edge of our machine, the best side to support the face on to prevent bending was the one that was over the screw hole.
        </p>

        <p>
          After our initial testing, we made a bunch of adjustments to improve the stability. First, we changed the depth of the rail supports from 5 mm to 10 mm and added support holes that we would be able to run a metal axle through to provide more stiffness without losing more workspace to the rail being pushed further into the mounts.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also added a second side for the idler pulley mount and changed it so that the axle would no longer be 3D printed and would instead be a metal axle that we would put in after the print. Lastly, we added an I-beam under the motor so that it would no longer be hanging off the back of the mount, and we added a roof to the motor mount which would connect it to a wall that was perpendicular to the mount, allowing for better support.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a part of some final adjustments after more testing, we added a slot on top of the rail mount for the limit switch to go in and a slot on the side of the mount to allow for wire management. We also added holes into the top of the motor mounts so that we would be able to see if the rails were fully pressed into the mounts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, we extended the rail mount holder further back. After the initial testing, we also added the belt mount on the side of the motor mount, which would allow it to be mounted to the y-axis belt so that it could be moved back and forth.
        </p>

        <p>
          After doing more testing, we found that the 3D print tolerancing was causing issues where the distance between the two sides of the mount was slightly less than that of the rail length, so the rail would be pushing the two sides apart, causing issues with movement and leveling. We also extended the back part of the rail mount holders back to allow for better support for the rail holder. This also allowed us to support the pulley walls on the idler pulley side, so they would be less likely to bend.
        </p>

        The Z-axis assembly moves the wood burner up and down and is the part that is connected to and moves on the X-axis.

      <div class="subsection">
        <h4>Design Needs</h4>
        <p>
          First, we determined the design needs for the Z-axis mount. It had to attach to the linear slide on the X-axis,
          clamp the ends of the belt, hold the wood-burning pen, and move the pen up and down. We wanted the Z-axis mount
          to be small and lightweight so the other axes had less mass to move.
        </p>
        <p>
          When testing the wood burner, we found that the depth of the tip into the wood had a large impact on the line produced.
          We needed precise control of the pen that was also sturdy and easily adjustable, so we determined a lead screw would be best.

          The fundamental design is a wood-burning pen clamped into a slider that rides on support rails and is moved by a lead screw.
          A motor is attached to the lead screw using a coupler, and a mounting piece holds the rails and motor in place. The back of the
          mount has holes to attach to the X-axis linear slide and includes a belt clamp.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h4>Manufacturing</h4>
        <p>
          We considered using a mill to make the mount and slider so the holes could be precisely positioned, reducing friction and instability.
          This would have been time-consuming and difficult to iterate on, so we chose 3D printing instead. The rods and printed parts have some
          compliance, and we designed the slider to be tall enough to prevent rotation and jamming, so exact machining-level precision was not critical.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h4>Sizing</h4>
        <p>
          We debated the travel length of the axis. We wanted a few inches of motion to accommodate different wood thicknesses without making the
          assembly too tall and unstable. The shortest lead screw we could find was 100 mm, which was close to the length we wanted, so we designed
          the mount around it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h4>Rod Mounts</h4>
        <p>
          We initially used free metal rods that were about 95 mm long, but the motor shaft and coupler added length at the top of the lead screw,
          meaning the rods could not span the full distance. Our first design used a large block to offset the motor and shaft collar.
        </p>
        <p>
          We could not find bolts that matched that configuration, and it would have been difficult to access the fasteners during assembly. We then tried
          a thinner motor mount with rod features extending out, but ultimately decided this complexity was unnecessary. Instead, we sourced longer rods and
          cut them to match the final motor mount.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h4>Hole Tolerancing</h4>
        <p>
          Another challenge was tolerancing the rail holes. The mount needs a tight press fit to hold the rods in place, while the slider needs to be loose
          enough to move smoothly without wobbling. We tried drilling printed parts to final size, but the plastic melted and the holes got worse. We printed a
          test piece with multiple hole sizes to identify the best fit.
        </p>
        <p>
          After one iteration where we misread the test piece orientation and made holes too large, we corrected the dimensions and achieved a good press fit and
          smooth sliding motion. If we had more time, we would add a secondary retention feature for the rods (beyond press fit). The press fit worked initially, but
          wore out over time, allowing rods to shift and occasionally slip out of position.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h4>Slide and Wood-Burner Clamp</h4>
        <p>
          Our teaching team raised a concern about the wood-burning tip catching on changing wood grain and recommended adding compliance. We considered springs or
          elastics, but it was difficult to add compliance without sacrificing stability. We ultimately mounted the pen using a clamp feature that prioritized repeatability
          and stiffness.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h4>3D Printing Considerations</h4>
        <p>
          We designed the parts with print orientation in mind. We printed the mount on its side so filament layers were strongest across the height of the piece,
          supporting the top and bottom. We printed the slide flat so the holes were smooth and dimensionally consistent. The precision-critical areas could not be printed
          with supports.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h4>Belt Clamp</h4>
        <p>
          On the back of the Z-axis mount, a small channel captures the two ends of the belt. Two clamping pieces have grooves that match the belt teeth; they bolt to the
          mount and clamp the belt in place.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h4>Limit Switch</h4>
        <p>
          We added a limit switch at the bottom of the Z-axis to simplify homing and prevent the tip from hitting the base plate. Near the end of the project, we realized
          placing the switch at the top would have been better because the pen should not need to travel all the way down to “zero” during typical operation. During testing,
          the slider occasionally traveled too far upward and hit the shaft coupler, causing binding that required pliers to free. A top limit switch would have prevented this.
          Ironically, an earlier rod-standoff concept would have provided a better hard stop that also reduced the chance of binding.
