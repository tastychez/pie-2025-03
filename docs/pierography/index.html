  <h3>PIErography</h3>
  <blockquote>PIErography is a 3-axis GRBL-controlled CNC pyrography machine that burns vector designs into wood using a heated tip</blockquote>

  <h3>Project Summary</h3>
  <p>
    In two months our goal was to design and build a CNC wood burning machine
    that can accurately burn custom designs onto wood surfaces. The system will use Grbl firmware
    to control X, Y, and Z-axes via stepper motors.

  <h2>Data and Energy Flow</h2>

  <h3>Data and Energy Flow Diagram</h3>
  <img src="media/power_flow.png" alt="Data and Energy Flow Diagram">
  <h3>Power Distribution</h3>
    <p>
    Most of the power in the system is distributed through the proto board. The power supply provides
    <strong>24 V</strong>, and the <strong>3 motor drivers</strong> connect to it via the proto board. During use, we usually
    saw around <strong>0.54 A</strong> being drawn, giving us around <strong>13 W</strong> total supplied from the power source to
    the stepper motor drivers.
  </p>

  <p>
    The drivers then regulate up to around <strong>2 A per motor phase</strong> with that higher supply, resulting in a
    lower effective coil voltage (around <strong>3 to 5 V</strong>) and an average power draw of around
    <strong>4–10 W per motor</strong>, depending on load and motion. <strong>10 W</strong> is more of an upper limit; during typical
    use, it is closer to <strong>4–5 W each</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The computer powers the Arduino separately via USB connection, sending roughly <strong>1–2 W</strong>
    (<strong>5 V</strong> × <strong>0.1–0.25 A</strong>). The wood-burning tool also has its own supply, providing
    <strong>27 W</strong> of power.
  </p>

  <h3>Control and Data Flow</h3>
  <p>
    The computer also sends and receives commands and data to/from the Arduino through the same USB cable.
    The Arduino then connects to most other components, since it is the controller of the system. It sends
    commands to all <strong>3 stepper motor drivers</strong>, telling them which direction to move, how quickly, and how
    far. The drivers convert those commands into regulated coil currents and send them to the stepper motors.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>3 limit switches</strong> send data back to the Arduino; when a switch is triggered, it trips an alarm in
    the code.

  <h2>Circuit Design</h2>
  <p>
    The power supply’s positive and negative terminals connect to the proto board in order to power the
    TB6600 stepper motor drivers. Wires run from the <strong>GND</strong> terminal of each driver to the power supply
    negative, and the driver <strong>VCC</strong> terminals connect to the power supply positive.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each stepper motor connects to its respective driver using the <strong>A+</strong>, <strong>A−</strong>, <strong>B+</strong>, and <strong>B−</strong>
    terminals. The driver supplies the motors with regulated coil currents to execute motion commands.
  </p>

  <p>
    The driver <strong>Signal</strong> terminals are used for connections to the Arduino. Each driver has
    <strong>PUL+</strong> and <strong>PUL−</strong>: <strong>PUL+</strong> connects to the Arduino <strong>step pulse</strong> pins
    (<strong>D2–D4</strong> in GRBL) and <strong>PUL−</strong> connects to Arduino ground. Each driver also has <strong>DIR+</strong> and
    <strong>DIR−</strong>: <strong>DIR+</strong> connects to the Arduino <strong>direction</strong> pins (<strong>D5–D7</strong> in GRBL) and
    <strong>DIR−</strong> connects to Arduino ground.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because all components that interface with the Arduino also need a shared ground reference, the Arduino
    <strong>GND</strong> is routed to a dedicated row on the proto board. This provides a common ground node for all
    driver signal returns and switch connections. Together, these connections allow motion control through
    the computer software (UGS) using GRBL G-code.
  </p>

  <p>
    The micro limit switches connect to both Arduino pins and ground. They are wired as
    <strong>normally closed (NC)</strong> for safety and improved robustness against electrical noise. The
    <strong>COM</strong> terminals connect to the Arduino ground row, and the <strong>NC</strong> terminals connect to the Arduino
    <strong>limit switch</strong> pins (<strong>D9</strong>, <strong>D10</strong>, and <strong>D12</strong> in GRBL).

  <h2>Mechanical Aspects</h2>

  <p class="mechanical-intro">
    The mechanical design prioritizes rigidity, repeatability, and ease of assembly. All CAD was developed in Onshape, which allowed the team
    to iterate quickly. The frame provides a stable reference plane for consistent burns, while
    belt-driven X and Y axes enable fast planar motion. A lead-screw Z axis was used to control burn depth and maintain consistent tool contact
    with the workpiece. Components were intentionally designed to be modular to support iteration, including swapping motors, re-tensioning
    belts, and adjusting the tool mount. Parts were fabricated using a combination of 3D printing and laser cutting, with structural elements
    cut using band saws and horizontal band saws to achieve accurate lengths and clean edges.

  <!-- X AXIS -->
  <div class="mech-block" id="mech-x">
    <h3>X-Axis</h3>

    <div class="mech-main">
      <div class="mech-text">
        <p><strong>Design Concepts:</strong></p>

        <p>
          For our x-axis, we started out with the basic idea of having an idler pulley on one side and a stepper motor driving the pulley on the other side. We wanted to attach the pen holder to the belt so that it would move along the x-axis as the motor moved the belt. To make sure that it would be secure, we added the mounts for the rail.
        </p>

        <p>
          We were originally planning on having each side supported by the same linear slide, but we found that each rail introduced a lot of friction into our y-axis movements, so we changed to a slider that mounted onto the extrusion. This made it so that we had to change the base of the mount so that it would be able to fit on the new slider.
        </p>

        <p>
          We extended the slots for the motor to allow it to slide back and forth. This would allow us to tension the belt. We also added a wall on the side with a screw hole in it which would allow space for a press plate that could be screwed in or loosened to apply more or less pressure to the side of the motor, for tensioning.
        </p>

        <p>
          When we tested the early versions of the x-axis, we had the motor and the idler pulley much lower down and they were at the edge of the mount. To make the spacing work better with the z-axis, we had to move the pulleys higher and further in. As a result, we found that we needed much more support in a lot of key areas when testing our design.
        </p>

        <p>
          The tension from the belt was causing the idler pulley support to bend inwards and we were worried that the axle it was on would snap. We also noticed that when we would push on one side, the other side would lag behind slightly, resulting in a noticeable gap when the side we were pushing on would reach the end of the y-axis.
        </p>

        <p>
          We figured that this was a result of the shallow supports for the rail as well as the pliability of the 3D prints. We also noticed that moving the motor in made supporting the face it was mounted to much more difficult since there was a screw hole right next to the motor’s side. Since the other side of the motor hung out over the edge of our machine, the best side to support the face on to prevent bending was the one that was over the screw hole.
        </p>

        <p>
          After our initial testing, we made a bunch of adjustments to improve the stability. First, we changed the depth of the rail supports from 5 mm to 10 mm and added support holes that we would be able to run a metal axle through to provide more stiffness without losing more workspace to the rail being pushed further into the mounts.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also added a second side for the idler pulley mount and changed it so that the axle would no longer be 3D printed and would instead be a metal axle that we would put in after the print. Lastly, we added an I-beam under the motor so that it would no longer be hanging off the back of the mount, and we added a roof to the motor mount which would connect it to a wall that was perpendicular to the mount, allowing for better support.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a part of some final adjustments after more testing, we added a slot on top of the rail mount for the limit switch to go in and a slot on the side of the mount to allow for wire management. We also added holes into the top of the motor mounts so that we would be able to see if the rails were fully pressed into the mounts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, we extended the rail mount holder further back. After the initial testing, we also added the belt mount on the side of the motor mount, which would allow it to be mounted to the y-axis belt so that it could be moved back and forth.
        </p>

        <p>
          After doing more testing, we found that the 3D print tolerancing was causing issues where the distance between the two sides of the mount was slightly less than that of the rail length, so the rail would be pushing the two sides apart, causing issues with movement and leveling. We also extended the back part of the rail mount holders back to allow for better support for the rail holder. This also allowed us to support the pulley walls on the idler pulley side, so they would be less likely to bend.
        </p>

    <h3>Z-Axis</h3>

    <div class="mech-main">
      <div class="mech-text">
        <p><strong>Design Concepts:</strong></p>

        <p>The Z-axis assembly moves the wood burner up and down and is connected to the X-axis.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Decided it should be short and lightweight so the other axes had less mass to move</li>
          <li>Long enough to allow for different height pieces to burn</li>
          <li>The shortest lead screw available was 100mm, which was close to the length of the axis we wanted, so we designed the mount around it.</li>
          <li>More precise and stable than other axes - decided on lead screw</li>
          <li>Need to be able to assemble - bolts needed to be accessible and not blocked by other parts</li>
          <li>Limit switch on bottom to prevent tip from hitting base plate. Would have been useful on the top to prevent binding and help zero</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Consider 3D printing,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mount needed to be printable on the side so layers are sturdy</li>
          <li>Slide needed to be vertical so holes were smooth with no supports, and most dimensionally accurate</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The rods we had at first were shorter than the lead screw, so I came up with different standoff options. Realized it would be very difficult to get bolts in and was unnecessary. Ended up getting longer rods. The slider didn’t have a purposeful hard stop at the top, so it would hit the shaft coupler and bind. Needed to use pliers to get it to unstick.
        </p>

        <p>Difficulty tolerancing</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Considered using mill to get holes perfectly smooth and toleranced, decided for such a small part with minimal force that level of precision was not necessary. The prints and rods would have some give, there was not much travel, and the slide was tall enough to not rotate and get stuck when it’s slightly loose, so it was not crucial to be exact.</li>
          <li>Tried drilling it out but it melted</li>
          <li>Printed a test size piece to determine hole sizes</li>
          <li>Considered using nylon bearings, but decided we could get a closer fit with 3D print</li>
          <li>The rails were a hard press fit at first but became loose by the end</li>

  <h2>Budget Breakdown</h2>

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Estimated spending is what we would have spent if we purchased every item (including items that were found/borrowed).
    Total spending is what we actually paid out-of-pocket.
